        <p class="lead">I am a non-traditional, self-taught programmer. I started hacking on a monochromatic DOS/Windows 3.1 machine at 9 years old and haven't stopped.</p>
        <p class="lead">Throughout my 19 year career, I have continuously worked in management positions—bringing technology to bear on hard problems, while honing my skills as a technologist as well as a compassionate and encouraging leader and mentor.</p>
        <p class="lead">I have excelled at tasks ranging from managing a team to build a multi-million dollar suite of web tools, to positioning a successful services company for a pivot to providing hardware and software. I can move deftly between high level vision and strategy, client relations, project management, visual design, systems architecture, DevOps, and software engineering.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">My core drivers are curiosity and compassion for all beings. I am looking for a team with lofty goals and a drive to use the skills and abilities we wield as technologists to do good in the world.</p>
